# Cinema-Ticket-Booking-System
This project is a simple console-based cinema ticket booking system written in Java. It allows users to choose a movie, confirm availability, and calculate the ticket price based on age restrictions and potential discounts.
Features:

Movie List: Displays a selection of movies with their availability, age restrictions, and ticket prices.

User Input: Allows users to enter their name, age, and select a movie.

Age Restrictions: Each movie has a minimum age requirement, and users are informed if they do not meet the criteria.

Availability Check: Movies that are unavailable are marked as such.

Discounts: Users can input if they have a discount card, which halves the ticket price.

Final Confirmation: After all conditions are checked, the system displays the final ticket price and confirms the reservation.

Requirements:

Java 8 or later
